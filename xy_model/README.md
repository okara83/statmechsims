xy-model - simulation of the the angle of the moment at a site is marked by a hue on the color wheel. Sliders modify "temperature" (the addition of random noise), an external field (positive pulls in the red direction, negative in the cyan), and interaction strength (below 0 the model becomes antiferromagnetic; above 0.25 the simulation becomes unstable).
